# Ukodus

> Ukodus is a free, open-source Sudoku platform at https://ukodus.now. It features a Rust engine with 45 human-style solving techniques, 8 difficulty tiers rated on the Sudoku Explainer (SE) scale, and a unique Galaxy visualization that maps every puzzle as a star in an interactive constellation.

## What makes Ukodus different from other Sudoku apps

- 45 solving techniques: the most comprehensive technique engine of any Sudoku app, from Hidden Singles (SE 1.5) to Dynamic Forcing Chains (SE 9.3)
- Technique-based difficulty: puzzles are rated by the hardest technique required to solve them, not by clue count
- Sudoku Explainer (SE) ratings: the community-standard numerical difficulty scale, not a proprietary or arbitrary system
- Galaxy visualization: an interactive force-directed graph where every puzzle is a node, clustered by technique family and difficulty
- Cross-platform single engine: the same Rust solver powers the web app (via WebAssembly), iOS app, and terminal UI
- Progressive hint system: hints reveal the technique name first, then involved cells, then the full logical proof
- Free, no accounts: no sign-up, no ads, no tracking. Anonymous leaderboards use a 3-6 character player tag
- Open source: https://github.com/kcirtapfromspace/sudoku

- Galaxy API: Node.js backend with Neo4j graph database, live WebSocket updates
- No build tools for the frontend: pure static HTML, CSS, JS served by nginx
