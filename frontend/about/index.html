          Most Sudoku apps generate puzzles by clue count and offer basic hints like

        <h2>45 solving techniques</h2>
        <p>
          The Ukodus engine implements the most comprehensive set of human-style Sudoku solving
          techniques of any browser-based Sudoku app. Every puzzle is rated by the hardest technique
          required to solve it without guessing, using the
          <a href="/techniques/">Sudoku Explainer (SE) difficulty scale</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 45 techniques are organized into 10 families: Singles, Pairs & Triples, Intersections,
          Fish (from X-Wing to Kraken Fish), Wings, Chains, Rectangles, Almost Locked Sets (ALS),
          Forcing Chains, and advanced patterns like Sue de Coq and Death Blossom.

      <section class="section about-section">
        <h2>Hints that teach you</h2>
        <p>
          When you request a hint, Ukodus doesn't just reveal the answer. It shows you the solving
          technique in three progressive steps:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> The technique name (e.g. "X-Wing on digit 4")</li>
          <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> The involved cells highlighted on the board</li>
          <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> A full logical proof showing exactly why the elimination or placement is valid</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This means every hint is a learning opportunity. Over time, you'll recognize these
          patterns yourself and need fewer hints.

        <p>
          Ukodus offers <a href="/difficulty/">8 difficulty tiers</a>, each defined by the solving

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Beginner</strong> (SE 1.5-2.0) — Hidden singles only</li>

          <li><strong>Intermediate</strong> (SE 3.4-3.8) — Hidden triples, basic fish</li>
          <li><strong>Hard</strong> (SE 3.8-4.5) — Box/line reduction, wings</li>
          <li><strong>Expert</strong> (SE 4.5-5.5) — Fish, rectangles, advanced wings</li>
          <li><strong>Master</strong> (SE 5.5-7.0) — Chains, ALS, Medusa (secret tier)</li>

          The <a href="/galaxy/">Galaxy</a> is a unique feature: an interactive force-directed

          techniques they share, with 10 families represented by different colors. New puzzles
          appear in real time via WebSocket. Zoom, pan, filter by technique, and click any star

        <h2>Built with Rust + WebAssembly</h2>
        <p>
          The engine is written in Rust and compiles to WebAssembly for the browser, native code
          for iOS (via UniFFI), and a terminal UI. The same solver, generator, and technique engine
          powers all three platforms — if you share a puzzle code between web and iOS, it's the
          exact same puzzle solved by the exact same engine.

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Is Ukodus really free?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes. No ads, no premium tier, no in-app purchases. The project is open source
            and funded by the developer.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Do I need to create an account?</h3>
          <p>
            No. Just open <a href="/play/">ukodus.now/play</a> and start playing. Your progress
            saves to your browser's localStorage. For leaderboards, you pick a 3-6 character
            tag (like "ACE") — no email or password.

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What makes the difficulty rating accurate?</h3>
          <p>
            Ukodus rates puzzles using the Sudoku Explainer (SE) scale, the community standard
            used by competitive Sudoku enthusiasts. The engine solves each puzzle using only
            human-style logic (no brute force), and the SE rating equals the hardest technique
            required. A puzzle rated SE 4.6 genuinely requires techniques like Unique Rectangle
            or XYZ-Wing.

          <h3>How does the hint system work?</h3>
          <p>
            Press <kbd>?</kbd> for a hint. The first press shows the technique name. Press again
            to see the involved cells highlighted. Press again for the full logical proof. Press
            <kbd>!</kbd> to apply the hint to the board. Every hint uses the same 45-technique
            engine that rates the puzzle.

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can I share puzzles?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes. Click Share to get an 8-character code (like <code>M1A2B3C4</code>) or a URL.
            The code works across the web app, iOS app, and terminal UI — same engine, same puzzle.

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What are the "secret" difficulty tiers?</h3>
          <p>
            Master (SE 5.5-7.0) and Extreme (SE 7.0-11.0) are hidden by default. They require
            advanced techniques like forcing chains, ALS chains, and 3D Medusa. They can be
            unlocked in the difficulty selection menu.

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Is there an iOS app?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes. The iOS app uses the same Rust engine compiled to native code via UniFFI. It
            supports Game Center leaderboards and iCloud sync. Share puzzle codes between web
            and iOS.

          <h3>Does Ukodus track me?</h3>
          <p>
            No. There are no analytics, no advertising trackers, no cookies. The only data sent
            to the server is anonymous gameplay results (time, difficulty, technique profile) for
            the Galaxy visualization and leaderboards. A randomly generated player ID is stored
            in your browser's localStorage. See our <a href="/privacy/">privacy policy</a>.
